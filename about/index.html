<p>
  Curvature is an intuitive graphical user interface for OpenStack, designed to take advantage of the OpenStack Neutron SDN (Software Defined Networking) service to provide the user with a powerful visualization tool for designing virtual application topologies. It is currently being developed at Cisco as a companion application for OpenStack to demonstrate the power of Neutron SDN.
  Curvature is designed to be used as an alternative to the standard Horizon dashboard for a more network-centric approach to application design and management. The visual nature of the user interface encourages greater insight into the process of virtual network design.
